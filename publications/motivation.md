The nonprofit sector largely consists of small, community-based organizations working with meager resources. For this reason, nonprofits rely on resources and research to operate more effectively. Prior researchers have begun to understand the impact of different linguistic structures and patterns on economic and organizational performance. This project furthers these efforts by addressing a research gap surrounding empathy and compassion in mission statements. We evaluate the impact of "self VS other" linguistic structures on revenues of tax-exempt organizations. This research will provide a better understanding of the impact of linguistic features and can be applied to increase charitable donations and elevate the impact of a wide array of nonprofits, thereby touching the lives of countless individuals.
