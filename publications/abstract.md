The nonprofit sector largely consists of small, community-based organizations working with meager resources; for this reason, nonprofits often depend on charitable giving. This research project provides a better understanding of the impact of mission statements of tax-exempt organizations, specifically in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada. We utilize the Python Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to web scrape mission statements, names, revenue, and other relevant data from the IRS, GuideStar, and Charity Navigator. After generating the data, we use techniques drawing from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and statistics to identify patterns in mission statements across different categories of tax-exempt organizations like religious charities and medical nonprofits. NLP libraries used include Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), RegularExpressions (RegEx), and SpaCy. In full, this project provides insight into the impact of mission statement language on generating revenue for fundraising efforts. This can then be applied to increase charitable donations and elevate the impact of a wide array of nonprofits, thereby touching the lives of countless individuals.
