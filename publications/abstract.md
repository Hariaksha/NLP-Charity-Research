This project provides a better understanding of the impact of mission statements of tax-exempt organizations, specifically nonprofits and charities, in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada. We utilize the Python Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to web scrape mission statements, names, tax classification numbers, and other relevant data from the IRS, GuideStar, and Charity Navigator. After generating the data, we use techniques drawing from Natural Language Processing and statistics to identify patterns in mission statements across different categories of tax-exempt organizations like religious charities and medical nonprofits. This provides insight into the impact of mission statement language on generating revenue for fundraising efforts.
