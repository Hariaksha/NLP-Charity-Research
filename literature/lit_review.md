This paper was written by two PhD candidates at Virginia Tech in 2017. It was presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition. The research used NLP to compare College of Engineering mission statements. Specifically, it used an NLP-based textual data analytical approach to study the mission and vision statements with the purpose of understanding the key similarities and differences between the choice of words used in them. 59 engineering colleges (29 public, 30 private) in the United States were analyzed. Results of this study indicate that there is indeed a difference in word frequencies for public versus private engineering colleges.

This paper was published in December 2023 by researchers in South Korea. The title is "Does mission concreteness make a difference in nonprofit performance? Automated text analysis approach to the importance of concrete mission statements."

It is very similar to this research project, but it correlates concreteness of mission statements to organizational performance, while this research looks for linguistic structures and keywords that affect revenue or fundraising efforts of nonprofits.

This paper was published in December 2023 by a Professor at Milligan University. It is titled "Relationship Between Mission Statement Components and ROA: A Study of Small-Cap Financial Firms." It investigates the correlation of mission statement comprehensiveness of 108 finance companies with economic performance, specifically Return on Assets (ROA). The study found that firms posting explicit mission statements on their websites had higher ROA means, firms including concern for public image had higher ROA growth, and firms including concern for employees had higher ROA means. However, mission statement comprehensiveness did not relate to firm performance.

This article was written by two professors at Marymount University and published in the Journal of Applied Business Research in May/June 2020. This research analyzed 772 mission/vision statements from companies using NLP. The data is categorized into 15 industry types. They say that they can see the 'features' of each industry and what they embrace through these statements. They also demonstrate high predictive power via ML to determine an industry by looking only at a mission or vision statement.

This study, titled "Persuasion in Fundraising Letters: An Interdisciplinary Study", was published in July 2009 in the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly. It analyzes the effectiveness of several techniques of persuasion used in direct mail. Results suggest that letters utilizing credibility appeals and letters written at a high level of readability produce the highest donations, indicating that certain linguistic structures or keywords can correlate with higher fundraising.

This study, titled "A Study on the Impact of Linguistic Persuasive Styles on the Sales Volume of Live Streaming Products in Social E-Commerce Environment", was written by professors at the Institute of Big Data Intelligent Management and Decision, College of Management, Shenzhen University, China in 2021. It looks at live-stream shopping and acknowledges that purchase behavior in live streaming is determined by some subjective factors, and the persuasiveness of linguistic style affects this subjective judgment to a certain extent. Therefore, changes in linguistic styles affects the consumer purchase intentions. This study divides linguistic persuasive style into five types: appealing to personality, appealing to logic, appealing to emotion, appealing to reward, and appealing to exaggeration. The results show that: the linguistic persuasive style of appealing to personality has the greatest positive impact on the sales volume of live broadcast products, but the linguistic style of appealing to logic has a negative impact. Interestingly, the same linguistic style has different effects for different types of products: the linguistic style of appealing to exaggeration has a negative effect on the sales volume of apparel products, but it has a positive influence on the sales volume of digital electrical products. Therefore, different linguistic styles should be used for different product types. This study suggests that linguistic structures and keywords can correlate with higher sales volume, or, in the case of nonprofits, charitable giving. It is also interesting that linguistic styles affect different shopping sectors differently; it should be investigated if different sectors of nonprofits will hold to different standards as well.

This article, titled "Go Pro Bono: Prosocial Language as a Success Factor in Crowdfunding" was published in 2017. It analyzes in its first study 164,056 projects from the online crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and found that higher percentages of prosocial words in project descriptions led to more investors and increased chances of reaching funding goals. In its second study with 234 projects, they found that increased use of prosocial words increases the support people thought they would give to a project. Overall, results indicate that people want to invest their financial resources in ventures that contribute to prosocial goals. This is relevant to research involving mission statements of nonprofits, which aim to increase fundraising efforts and charitable giving.

These two links above are NOT research, but they explain what each NTEE code is. The NTEE code is a three-digit code that specifies an exempt organizationâ€™s purpose. The National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCSS) developed the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) coding system as a way to categorize nonprofit organizations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses this system to classify tax exempt organizations into different categories according to their purpose. The NTEE code is a quick way for a potential donor or grantor to know what a charity does at a glance.
