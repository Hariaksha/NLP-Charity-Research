This paper was written by two PhD candidates at Virginia Tech in 2017. It was presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition. The research used NLP to compare College of Engineering mission statements. Specifically, it used an NLP-based textual data analytical approach to study the mission and vision statements with the purpose of understanding the key similarities and differences between the choice of words used in them. 59 engineering colleges (29 public, 30 private) in the United States were analyzed. Results of this study indicate that there is indeed a difference in word frequencies for public versus private engineering colleges.

This study, titled "A Study on the Impact of Linguistic Persuasive Styles on the Sales Volume of Live Streaming Products in Social E-Commerce Environment", was written by professors at the Institute of Big Data Intelligent Management and Decision, College of Management, Shenzhen University, China in 2021. It looks at live-stream shopping and acknowledges that purchase behavior in live streaming is determined by some subjective factors, and the persuasiveness of linguistic style affects this subjective judgment to a certain extent. Therefore, changes in linguistic styles affects the consumer purchase intentions. This study divides linguistic persuasive style into five types: appealing to personality, appealing to logic, appealing to emotion, appealing to reward, and appealing to exaggeration. The results show that: the linguistic persuasive style of appealing to personality has the greatest positive impact on the sales volume of live broadcast products, but the linguistic style of appealing to logic has a negative impact. Interestingly, the same linguistic style has different effects for different types of products: the linguistic style of appealing to exaggeration has a negative effect on the sales volume of apparel products, but it has a positive influence on the sales volume of digital electrical products. Therefore, different linguistic styles should be used for different product types. This study suggests that linguistic structures and keywords can correlate with higher sales volume, or, in the case of nonprofits, charitable giving. It is also interesting that linguistic styles affect different shopping sectors differently; it should be investigated if different sectors of nonprofits will hold to different standards as well.

This article, titled "Go Pro Bono: Prosocial Language as a Success Factor in Crowdfunding" was published in 2017. It analyzes in its first study 164,056 projects from the online crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and found that higher percentages of prosocial words in project descriptions led to more investors and increased chances of reaching funding goals. In its second study with 234 projects, they found that increased use of prosocial words increases the support people thought they would give to a project. Overall, results indicate that people want to invest their financial resources in ventures that contribute to prosocial goals. This is relevant to research involving mission statements of nonprofits, which aim to increase fundraising efforts and charitable giving.
