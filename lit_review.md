This paper was written by two PhD candidates at Virginia Tech in 2017. It was presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition. The research used NLP to compare College of Engineering mission statements. Specifically, it used an NLP-based textual data analytical approach to study the mission and vision statements with the purpose of understanding the key similarities and differences between the choice of words used in them. 59 engineering colleges (29 public, 30 private) in the United States were analyzed. Results of this study indicate that there is indeed a difference in word frequencies for public versus private engineering colleges.
