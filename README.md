I started this project in January 2024 with Dr. Michael Price, a Professor of Economics at The University of Alabama with research projects related to charitable giving.

The project involves gathering mission statements from tax-exempt organizations (nonprofits/charities) from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. We used the Python requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to accomplish this with web scraping. The United States data was scraped from GuideStar and Charity Navigator.

Afterwards, we used Natural Language Processing techniques to identify patterns among these mission statements, with the goal of seeing how mission statements impact fundraising. We hope that this research benefits future charitable giving.
